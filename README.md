# @curiosbasant/react-compooks

This is my frequently used react hooks, which I'll install in almost every project I create or work on. So that I don't have to keep copy pasting the files in each project.

Most of them are inspired by WDS on `youtube`

To install

```
yarn add @curiosbasant/react-compooks
```

OR

```
npm install @curiosbasant/react-compooks
```
